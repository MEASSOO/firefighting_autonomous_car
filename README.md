# Firefighting Autonomous Car
We are students in **MSA University** Faculty of Engineering Department of **Mechatronics Systems Engineering**

Under the supervision of [**Dr. Amgad M. Bayoumy**](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Amgad-Bayoumy-Aly-2) in Introduction To Mechatronics MSE254

# Explanation of Project
This project simply to catch fire and go to by algorithm navigation to fire extinguishing by water.
We used **Micropython** because python provide a large number of libraries and easy to understand.
**Micropython** With ESP32 that make more feutures to project such: **OTA System** With **Backend Server** to Upload Updates to Make The Project System is Integrated.

# Libraries That Used
### DCMotor
### Servo
### OTA 


# Future Improvements
This is a list of improvements we intended to make but ran out of time:
#### 1 - Water Station
> This station that if the water level sensor reads water is low in tank then autonomous car heading to this station to fill the tank.
>
#### 2 - Mobile Application
> This application communicate with ota and backend server to check updates available and install it by application and this application make notification for user if autonomous car found fire and if it arrives to fire location and if field in application that contain Water level in tank and control of car if any issues happend.
